# 6. Develop a program that takes as input an hourly wage and the number of hours an employee worked in the last week. The program should compute and return the employeeâ€™s pay. Overtime work is calculated as: any hours beyond 40 but less than or equal 60 should be paid at 1.5 times the regular hourly wage. Any hours beyond 60 should be paid at 2 times the regular hourly wage.

def calculate(time,wage):
    if time>=40 and time<=60:
        return 1.5*time*wage
    elif time>60:
        return 2*time*wage
    else:
        return time*wage
    
time=int(input("Enter the number of hour employee worked last week\n"))
wage=float(input("enter the wage for each hour\n"))

print("last week pay is:",calculate(time,wage))
